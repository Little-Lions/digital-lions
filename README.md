Digital Lions is the application used by volunteers and coaches from Little Lions Child Coaching. [Little Lions Child Coaching](https://littlelionschildcoaching.com/) is an NGO that guides children from the townships of Cape Town in providing mental support. The application allows coaches and volunteers in the field to track workshops and classes. It consists of three simple components: a frontend that talks to a Python backend API which on its turn communicates with a PostgresSQL DB.
